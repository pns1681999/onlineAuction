                sale and supply of Products. When you submit an Order to us, give any delivery instruction or accept
                delivery of the Products, this shall in any event constitute your unqualified acceptance of these Terms
                and Conditions. Nothing in these Terms and Conditions affects your statutory rights (including the right
                to insist that goods you buy from businesses must correspond with their description, be fit for their
                purpose and be of satisfactory quality).

                3.2 These Terms and Conditions shall prevail over any separate terms put forward by you. Any conditions
                that you submit, propose or stipulate in whatever form and at whatever time, whether in writing, by
                email or orally, are expressly waived and excluded.

                3.3 No other terms or changes to the Terms and Conditions shall be binding unless agreed in writing
                signed by us.

                4. How a Contract is formed
                4.1 When making an Order, you must register for an Account on the Site as detailed in clause 10, and you
                must follow the instructions on the Site as to how to make your Order and for making changes to your
                prospective Order before you submit it to the Site.

                4.2 Irrespective of any previous price you have seen or heard, once you select a Product that you wish
                to Order, you will then be shown or told (on the Site) the charges you must pay including taxes, if
                applicable, and any applicable delivery charges. Unless otherwise stipulated on the Site, all charges
                are in the currency then in force in Thailand. Subject to clause 4.11 below, this is the total that you
                will pay for receipt of the ordered Product.

                You shall pay for the Product in full at the time of ordering by supplying us with your credit or debit
                card details from a credit or debit card company acceptable to us or by Paypal, which we require in
                order to process your Order. Alternatively, you may pay by any method that we have said is acceptable to
                us, but in any event we shall not be bound to supply before we have received cleared funds in full. Your
                payment will be received by our agent, Chilindo Co. Ltd., Thanon Bearing Soi 15, Moo 10, Samrong Nuea,
                10270 Samut Prakan
                Company Registration Number: 0105556155061 a company registered in Thailand (and a company wholly owned
                by us). Depending on the results of a credit check we reserve the right not to offer certain forms of
                payment and to refer you to our other forms of payment.

                4.4 If you are asked for details of a payment card, you must be fully entitled to use that card or
                account. The card or account must have sufficient funds to cover the proposed payment to us.

                4.5 You undertake that all details you provide to us for the purpose of purchasing the Product from us
                will be correct, that the credit or debit card, or account or other payment method which you use is your
                own and that there are sufficient funds or credit facilities to cover the cost of the Product. We
                reserve the right to obtain validation of your payment details before providing you with the Product.

                4.6 When you submit an Order to the Site, you agree that you do so subject to these Terms and Conditions
                current at the date you submit your Order. You are responsible for reviewing the latest Terms and
                Conditions each time you submit your Order.

                4.7 Your Order remains valid as an offer until we issue our Confirmation of Order or, if earlier, when
                we receive your notice revoking your Order.

                4.8 We shall not be obliged to supply the Product to you until we have accepted your Order. Unless
                expressly stating that we accept your order, an email, letter, fax or other Acknowledgement of your
                Order by us is purely for information purposes and does not constitute the Confirmation of Order. In
                that Acknowledgement, we may give you an Order reference number and details of the Product you have
                ordered. We may in our discretion refuse to accept an Order from you for any reason, including
                unavailability of supplies or we may offer you an alternative Product (in which case we may require you
                to re-submit your Order first).

                4.9 A Contract shall be formed and we shall be legally bound to supply the Product to you when we accept
                your Order. Acceptance shall take place when we expressly accept your Order by email to you, in the form
                of a document called a "Confirmation of Order" stating that we are accepting your Order. Our
                Confirmation of Order shall be deemed to come into effect when it has been dispatched by us. Without
                affecting your obligation to pay us earlier, we may send an invoice to you at any time after we have
                accepted your Order. Until the time when we accept your Order, we reserve the right to refuse to process
                your Order and you reserve the right to cancel your Order. If we or you have cancelled your Order before
                we have accepted it, then we will promptly refund any payment already made by you or your credit or
                debit card company to us for the order of the Product.

                4.10 If you discover that you have made a mistake with your Order after you have submitted it to the
                Site, please contact support@chilindo.com immediately. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able
                to amend your Order in accordance with your instructions.

                4.11 We try very hard to ensure that the price given to you is accurate, but the price of your Order
                will need to be validated by us as part of our acceptance procedure. If the price for the Order changes
                before we accept your Order, we will contact you and ask you to confirm that you wish to proceed at the
                amended price.

                4.12 A Contract will relate only to those Products whose dispatch we have confirmed in the Confirmation
                of Order. We will not be obliged to supply any other Products which may have been part of your Order
                until we have sent a Confirmation of Order in relation to those Products.

                4.13 You must only submit to us or our agent or the Site information which is accurate and not
                misleading and you must keep it up to date and inform us of changes.

                5. Delivery
                5.1 We aim to deliver the Product to you at the place of delivery requested by you in your Order.

                5.2 We aim to deliver within the time indicated by us at the time of your Order (and updated in the
                Confirmation of Order) but we cannot promise an exact date when you submit your Order or at the
                Confirmation of Order. We always aim to deliver within the stipulated time frame of any Order, which we
                accept but we cannot guarantee any firm delivery dates.

                5.3 We shall aim to let you know if we expect that we are unable to meet our estimated delivery date,
                but, to the extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable to you for any losses, liabilities, costs,
                damages, charges or expenses arising out of late delivery.

                5.4 On delivery of the Product, you may be required to sign for delivery. You agree to inspect the
                Product for any obvious faults, defects or damage before you sign for delivery. You need to keep receipt
                of the delivered Product in case of future discussions with us about it.

                5.5 Please note that it might not be possible for us to deliver to some locations. If this is the case,
                we will inform you using the contact details that you provide to us when you make your Order and arrange
                for cancellation of the Order or delivery to an alternative delivery address.

                5.6 We deliver in our standard packaging. Any special packaging requested by you is subject to
                additional charges.

                5.7 All risk in the Product shall pass to you upon delivery, except that, where delivery is delayed due
                to a breach of your obligations under a Contract, risk shall pass at the date when delivery would have
                occurred but for your breach. From the time when risk passes to you, we will not be liable for loss or
                destruction of the Product.

                5.8 You must take care when opening the Product so as not to damage it, particularly when using any
                sharp instruments.

                5.9 You shall ensure that you are ready for safe receipt of the Product without undue delay and at any
                time reasonably specified by us.

                5.10 If you are not available to take delivery or collection, we may leave a card giving you
                instructions on either re-delivery or collection from the carrier.

                5.11 If delivery or collection is delayed through your unreasonable refusal to accept delivery or if you
                do not (within two weeks of our first attempt to deliver the Product to you) accept delivery or collect
                the Product from the carrier, then we may (without affecting any other right or remedy available to us)
                do either or both of the following:

                a) charge you for our reasonable storage fee and other costs reasonably incurred by us; or

                b) no longer make the Product available for delivery or collection and notify you that we are
                immediately cancelling the applicable Contract, in which case we will refund to you or your credit or
                debit card company as applicable any money already paid to us under the applicable Contract, less our
                reasonable administration charges (including for attempting to deliver and then returning the Product,
                and any storage fees as provided for in clause 5.11(a) above).

                5.12 It is your responsibility to ensure that the Products are sufficient and suitable for your purposes
                and meet your individual requirements. We do not warrant that the Products will meet your individual
                requirements. You acknowledge that the Products are standard and not made bespoke to fit any particular
                requirements that you may have.

                6. Cancellation
                6.1 We may cancel a Contract if the Product is not available for any reason. We will notify you if this
                is the case and return any payment that you have made.

                6.2 We will usually refund any money received from you using the same method originally used by you to
                pay for the Product.

                7. Cancellation by Customer (Non-Faulty Product)
                If you wish to cancel your order please contact our Customer Service Team via email. No cancellation
                fees apply. Once an order has been dispatched it may not be cancelled and the item must instead be
                returned to the company according to guidelines provided by the costumer care department (Please call
                the above stated number or refer to your return-slip provided in your received parcel).

                8. Faulty Products
                8.1 We warrant that:

                a) the Product will be delivered undamaged in the quantities ordered; and

                b) the Product will conform with the manufacturer's latest published instructions as set out on the Site
                or in our Product material at the time of your Order.

                8.2 The Product is intended to be used strictly in accordance with the manufacturer's latest published
                instructions as set out on the Site or as on the Product itself. It is your responsibility to ensure
                that you use the Product strictly in accordance with those instructions.

                8.3 Before delivery, we may make minor adjustments to material, colour, weight, measurements, design and
                other features to the extent that they are reasonable.

                8.4 We try very hard to deliver Products in excellent condition. However, if you tell us that the
                Product is faulty, you agree to keep the Product in its current condition available for us (or our
                agent) to inspect within a reasonable time.

                8.5 In order to provide you with any remedies for a faulty Product, we may need your assistance and
                prompt provision of certain information regarding the Product, including:

                a) you specifying with reasonable detail the way in which it is alleged that the Product is damaged or
                defective; and

                b) you providing us with the delivery note number and such other information as we reasonably require.

                8.6 If you would like us to repair, replace or provide a refund for the Product where it did conform to
                the applicable Contract, and we find that the Product has:

                a) been misused, abused or subjected to neglect, improper or inadequate care, carelessness, damage or
                abnormal conditions; or

                b) been involved in any accident or damage caused by an incorrect attempt at modification or repair; or

                c) been dealt with or used contrary to our or the manufacturer's instructions for the Product; or

                d) deteriorated through normal wear and tear, after delivery by us, we may at our discretion decide not
                to repair, replace or refund you for the Product and/or we may require you to pay all reasonable
                carriage costs and servicing costs at our current standard fees and costs and charge this to your credit
                or debit card, or the payment details that you provided to us when you made your Order, and, to the
                extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable to you for any losses, liabilities, costs, damages,
                charges or expenses as a result.

                c) Only returns via courier service is accepted, as we do not honor any walk-ins. Refunds will be made
                by means of store credit in the form of voucher (valid for 365 days from the day of return) or we will
                transfer the full payment amount excluding the 10% service charge.

                Store credit can be used to make future purchases through our website. In the event that we send you a
                wrong item or the item is defective, we will send you a replacement item. Should the item be out of
                stock, we will issue a cash refund.

                11. Limitation of Liability
                This clause 10 prevails over all other clauses and sets forth our entire Liability, and your sole and
                exclusive remedies, for:
                a) the performance, non-performance, purported performance or delay in performance of these Terms and
                Conditions or a Contract or the Site (or any part of it or them); or

                b) otherwise in relation to these Terms and Conditions or the entering into or performance of these
                Terms and Conditions.

                12. Guarantee and complaints management
                11.1 We shall perform our obligations under these Terms and Conditions with reasonable skills and care.

                11.2 We place great value on our customer satisfaction. You may contact us at any time using the contact
                details given in clause 1.1 of these Terms and Conditions. We will attempt to address your concerns as
                soon as reasonably possible and will contact you on receipt of any relevant enquiry or complaint. In
                guarantee cases, the manufacturer frequently must be involved, and as such it may take longer to resolve
                such an enquiry or complaint.

                11.3 In the event of a complaint it will help us if you can describe the object of your complaint as
                accurately as possible and, where applicable, send us copies of the Order or at least the order number
                that we assign you in the Acknowledgement or Confirmation of Order. Should you not have received any
                reaction from us within five Business Days, please make further enquiries. In rare cases your emails may
                be caught up in our spam filters or not reach us, or correspondence that we send to you may otherwise
                not have reached you.

                13. Data protection
                Please see our Privacy Policy, which forms part of these Terms and Conditions.

                14. Circumstances beyond our control (Force Majeure clause)
                13.1 We shall not be liable to you for any breach, hindrance or delay in the performance of a Contract

                disaster and unavoidable incident, actions of third parties (including without limitation hackers,
                suppliers, governments, quasi-governmental, supra-national or local authorities), insurrection, riot,
                civil commotion, war, hostilities, warlike operations, national emergencies, terrorism, piracy, arrests,

                (including electrical, telecoms or Internet failure), shortage of or inability to obtain supplies,
                materials, equipment or transportation ("Event of Force Majeure"), regardless of whether the
                circumstances in question could have been foreseen.

                13.2 Either you or we may terminate a Contract forthwith by written notice to the other in the event
                that the Event of Force Majeure lasts for a period of two Business Days or more, in which event neither
                you nor we shall be liable to the other by reason of such termination (other than for the refund of a
                Product already paid for by you and not delivered).

                13.3 If we have contracted to provide identical or similar Products to more than one Customer and are
                prevented from fully meeting our obligations to you by reason of an Event of Force Majeure, we may
                decide at our absolute discretion which contracts we will perform and to what extent.
